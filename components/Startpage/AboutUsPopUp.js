                        Welcome to StudyHub!
                        We're a small team consisting of four students; Felix "the backend monster" Maathz, Gabriel "leaflet" Martens, Simon "chat chad" Olofsson and Hugo "CSS king" Aszt√©ly.
                        This web application was made as a project for one of our courses at Uppsala University, but we hope it doesn't stop as a school project, and that it actually becomes a
                        useful and maybe even fun tool for students in their studies.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        We hope you enjoy our web application!
